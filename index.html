        <h2>Animal Farm</h2>
        <p>
          The animal populace of the poorly run Manor Farm near Willingdon,
          England, is ripened for rebellion by neglect at the hands of the
          irresponsible and alcoholic farmer Mr. Jones. One night, the exalted
          boar Old Major holds a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow
          of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called "Beasts
          of England". When Old Major dies, two young adult boars, Snowball and
          Napoleon, assume command and stage a revolt, driving out Mr. Jones and
          renaming the property "Animal Farm". The animals adopt the Seven
          Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is "All animals
          are equal". These rules are painted in large letters on one side of
          the barn.

        <h2>Whale Rider</h2>
        <p id="para2">
          Set in the 1980s in Whangara, a Māori community on the eastern edge of
          New Zealand's North Island, the novel is a retelling of the myth of
          Paikea. Kahu is the eldest great-grandchild of chief Koro Apirana; had
          she been a boy, she would have been the future leader of the tribe but
          since she is a girl, she is detested by her grandfather Koro Apirana
          who is a male chauvinist who is blinded by culture. She is attuned to
          the traditional Māori way of life, and has inherited the ability to
          speak to whales. The novel is narrated by Kahu's uncle, Rawiri, who
          travels to Australia and Papua New Guinea where the narrative focuses
          on the shaping of his own understanding of his Māori identity.

        <h2>Doll's House</h2>
        <p id="box-model">
          The play opens around Christmas time as Nora Helmer enters her home
          carrying many packages and presents. Nora's husband, Torvald, is
          working in his study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for
          spending so much money on Christmas gifts, calling her his "little
          squirrel". He teases her about how, the previous year, she had spent
          weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce.
          This year, Torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so
          Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. The maid
          announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's,
          who has come seeking employment; and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the
          family, who is let into the study.
